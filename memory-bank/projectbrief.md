# Project Brief: EmbedIQ

## Project Overview

EmbedIQ is a cloud-based RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that leverages high-quality embedding search and LLM context-based answers. It serves both developers through API endpoints and end users via a web application.

## Core Goals

- Create a high-performance, scalable RAG service using the LightRAG framework
- Develop a comprehensive API layer for developers to integrate with their applications
- Build an intuitive web interface for end users to submit queries and receive AI-generated answers
- Ensure the system is reliable, secure, and maintainable using modern development practices

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Document ingestion and embedding generation
- Vector search capabilities for retrieving relevant context
- LLM integration for generating context-based answers
- User authentication and authorization
- Usage tracking and analytics
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Responsive web interface

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Sub-second response times for API queries
- Horizontal scalability through containerization
- Security through HTTPS, RBAC, and data encryption
- High availability and resilience
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- GDPR and data privacy compliance

## Success Criteria

- System can successfully ingest documents and generate embeddings
- Search functionality returns relevant results based on vector similarity
- LLM generates high-quality, contextually relevant answers
- API endpoints work as documented with proper authentication
- Web interface provides good user experience across devices
- System can scale to handle increased load
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

## Project Phases

1. MVP Development: Core API, LightRAG integration, basic frontend
2. Enhancement: Authentication, improved UX/UI, performance optimization
3. Production Deployment: Orchestration, security audits, user feedback integration
