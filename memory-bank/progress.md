# Progress: EmbedIQ

## Project Status: Initial Implementation Phase

The EmbedIQ project has completed the initial planning phase and entered the implementation phase. We have set up the core project structure and scaffolding for both backend and frontend components.

## What Works

- âœ… Memory Bank documentation established
- âœ… Core product vision and requirements defined
- âœ… System architecture and component relationships outlined
- âœ… Technology stack decisions made
- âœ… Development workflow and practices documented
- âœ… Initial repository structure created
- âœ… Docker and Docker Compose configuration created
- âœ… FastAPI application structure implemented
- âœ… Basic API endpoints (health, ingest, search, query) defined
- âœ… Data models and schemas created
- âœ… React frontend structure implemented with Material-UI
- âœ… Frontend pages and navigation established

## What's in Progress

- ðŸ”„ PostgreSQL integration with vector extensions
- ðŸ”„ Document processing pipeline
- ðŸ”„ Frontend-API integration
- ðŸ”„ Authentication system

## What's Left to Build

  - â¬œ Authentication UI

- â¬œ DevOps
  - âœ… Docker configuration
  - âœ… Docker Compose for local development
  - â¬œ CI/CD pipeline setup
  - â¬œ Testing infrastructure

### Phase 2: Enhancement

- â¬œ Authentication System
- â¬œ Advanced Frontend Features
- â¬œ Performance Optimization
- â¬œ Monitoring and Logging
- â¬œ Additional LLM Integrations

### Phase 3: Production Deployment

- â¬œ Containerization for Production
- â¬œ Orchestration Setup
- â¬œ Security Audits
- â¬œ Production Monitoring
- â¬œ User Documentation

## Current Milestone Progress

### Milestone: Project Setup

- âœ… Define project requirements and scope
- âœ… Document system architecture
- âœ… Select technology stack
- âœ… Set up development environment
- âœ… Create initial repository structure
- â¬œ Establish CI/CD pipeline

## Current Sprint Goals

1. âœ… Complete memory bank documentation
2. âœ… Set up initial repository structure
3. âœ… Configure development environment with Docker Compose
4. âœ… Create skeleton applications for backend and frontend
5. ðŸ”„ Implement database integration
6. ðŸ”„ Connect frontend to API
7. ðŸ”„ Implement document processing

## Known Issues and Risks

### Technical Issues

- Mock implementations in place of real embedding generation and LLM integration
- File upload and document processing not yet implemented
- Authentication system not yet implemented

### Potential Risks

1. **LLM Integration**: Potential challenges with integrating and optimizing LLM providers
2. **Vector Database Performance**: Need to ensure PostgreSQL with pgvector meets performance requirements
3. **LLM API Costs**: Need to manage costs associated with LLM API usage
4. **Scaling Challenges**: May face challenges when scaling to handle large document collections

## Next Evaluation Point

After completing the database integration and connecting the frontend to the API, we will evaluate progress and adjust the plan as needed.

## Metrics to Track

- Development velocity (story points completed per sprint)
- Test coverage percentage
- API response times
- Vector search latency
- End-to-end query processing time

## Open Questions

- Should we implement user management in the initial MVP or defer to a later phase?
- How should we handle embedding model updates and reprocessing?
- What level of caching should we implement for performance optimization?
- How should we structure the authentication system for both API and frontend?
