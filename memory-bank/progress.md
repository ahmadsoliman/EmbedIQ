## Task Management

The task-master system has been updated to reflect the current project status with the following tasks marked as completed:

1. âœ… Task ID 1: Setup Docker Development Environment

   - âœ… Create Service-Specific Dockerfiles
   - âœ… Configure Docker Compose for Local Development
   - â¬œ Implement Development Scripts and Documentation

2. âœ… Task ID 3: Create FastAPI Application Structure

3. âœ… Task ID 8: Setup React Frontend Application

The next task to work on according to the task-master recommendation is:

- Task ID 2: Implement PostgreSQL Database with Vector Extensions (blocked on ARM64 compatibility issue)

## Known Issues and Risks

### Technical Issues

- PostgreSQL Docker image with pgvector and Apache AGE crashes on ARM64 architecture (Apple Silicon)
- SQLAlchemy naming conflicts with 'metadata' attribute requiring renaming in models
- Mock implementations in place of real embedding generation and LLM integration
- File upload and document processing not yet implemented
- Authentication system not yet implemented

### Potential Risks

1. **Docker Image Compatibility**: PostgreSQL with vector extensions may have ongoing compatibility issues with ARM64 architecture
2. **LLM Integration**: Potential challenges with integrating and optimizing LLM providers
3. **Vector Database Performance**: Need to ensure PostgreSQL with pgvector meets performance requirements
4. **LLM API Costs**: Need to manage costs associated with LLM API usage
5. **Scaling Challenges**: May face challenges when scaling to handle large document collections

## Next Evaluation Point

After resolving the PostgreSQL ARM64 compatibility issues and completing the LightRAG integration, we will evaluate progress and adjust the plan as needed.

## Metrics to Track

- Development velocity (story points completed per sprint)
- Test coverage percentage
- API response times
- Vector search latency
- End-to-end query processing time

## Open Questions

- What PostgreSQL Docker image is most compatible with ARM64 architecture while supporting pgvector and Apache AGE?
- Should we explore alternative vector database options if PostgreSQL compatibility issues persist?
- Should we implement user management in the initial MVP or defer to a later phase?
- How should we handle embedding model updates and reprocessing?
- What level of caching should we implement for performance optimization?
- How should we structure the authentication system for both API and frontend?
