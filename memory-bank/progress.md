# Progress: EmbedIQ

## Project Status: Planning Phase

The EmbedIQ project is currently in the planning and initial setup phase. We are establishing the foundation for development by creating comprehensive documentation and defining the architecture.

## What Works

- âœ… Memory Bank documentation established
- âœ… Core product vision and requirements defined
- âœ… System architecture and component relationships outlined
- âœ… Technology stack decisions made
- âœ… Development workflow and practices documented

## What's in Progress

- ðŸ”„ Repository structure setup
- ðŸ”„ Development environment configuration
- ðŸ”„ Initial project scaffolding

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: MVP Development

- â¬œ API Layer

  - â¬œ FastAPI application structure
  - â¬œ Health endpoint
  - â¬œ Ingest endpoint
  - â¬œ Search endpoint
  - â¬œ Query endpoint
  - â¬œ API documentation

- â¬œ Core Processing

  - â¬œ LightRAG integration
  - â¬œ Document ingestion pipeline
  - â¬œ Embedding generation
  - â¬œ Vector search implementation
  - â¬œ LLM context augmentation

- â¬œ Database

  - â¬œ PostgreSQL setup with vector extensions
  - â¬œ Database models
  - â¬œ Migration scripts
  - â¬œ Data access layer

- â¬œ Frontend

  - â¬œ React application setup
  - â¬œ Landing page
  - â¬œ Query interface
  - â¬œ Results display
  - â¬œ API client integration

- â¬œ DevOps
  - â¬œ Docker configuration
  - â¬œ Docker Compose for local development
  - â¬œ CI/CD pipeline setup
  - â¬œ Testing infrastructure

### Phase 2: Enhancement

- â¬œ Authentication System
- â¬œ Advanced Frontend Features
- â¬œ Performance Optimization
- â¬œ Monitoring and Logging
- â¬œ Additional LLM Integrations

### Phase 3: Production Deployment

- â¬œ Containerization for Production
- â¬œ Orchestration Setup
- â¬œ Security Audits
- â¬œ Production Monitoring
- â¬œ User Documentation

## Current Milestone Progress

### Milestone: Project Setup

- âœ… Define project requirements and scope
- âœ… Document system architecture
- âœ… Select technology stack
- ðŸ”„ Set up development environment
- â¬œ Create initial repository structure
- â¬œ Establish CI/CD pipeline

## Current Sprint Goals

1. Complete memory bank documentation
2. Set up initial repository structure
3. Configure development environment with Docker Compose
4. Create skeleton applications for backend and frontend

## Known Issues and Risks

### Technical Issues

- No implementation issues yet as we're in the planning phase

### Potential Risks

1. **LightRAG Integration**: Potential challenges with integrating and optimizing the LightRAG framework
2. **Vector Database Performance**: Need to ensure PostgreSQL with vector extensions meets performance requirements
3. **LLM API Costs**: Need to manage costs associated with LLM API usage
4. **Scaling Challenges**: May face challenges when scaling to handle large document collections

## Next Evaluation Point

Once the initial repository structure and development environment are set up, we will evaluate progress and adjust the plan as needed. This is expected within the next sprint.

## Metrics to Track

- Development velocity (story points completed per sprint)
- Test coverage percentage
- API response times
- Vector search latency
- End-to-end query processing time

## Open Questions

- What UI framework will be most suitable for the frontend?
- Should we use Kubernetes for initial deployment or start with a simpler approach?
- Which LLM providers should we support initially?
- How will we handle embedding model updates and reprocessing?
