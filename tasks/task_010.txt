# Task ID: 10
# Title: Connect Frontend to API and Implement Results Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 7, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Integrate frontend with backend APIs and create visualization for query results.
# Details:
Connect document upload interface to '/ingest' API endpoint. Integrate query interface with '/query' endpoint. Implement results visualization that displays LLM-generated responses with source attribution. Create highlighting for source references in original documents. Implement error handling for API communication failures. Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations. Create feedback mechanism for result quality assessment.

# Test Strategy:
Test end-to-end workflow from document upload to query results. Validate source attribution display. Test with various document types and queries. Verify error handling during API failures. Test performance with large result sets. Gather user feedback on visualization clarity.
