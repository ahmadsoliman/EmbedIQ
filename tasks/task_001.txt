# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Docker Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Docker and Docker Compose for local development with containers for all required services.
# Details:
Create Dockerfiles for each service: Frontend, API, and PostgreSQL with extensions. Set up Docker Compose configuration that defines service relationships, network configuration, and volume mounts. Ensure compatibility with both ARM64 and x86_64 architectures by testing alternative PostgreSQL images or building custom images if needed. Include environment variable configuration and setup scripts for initial development.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all containers start successfully with docker-compose up. Test cross-container communication. Confirm PostgreSQL extensions (pgvector, Apache AGE) are properly installed and accessible. Validate development workflow on both ARM64 and x86_64 architectures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Service-Specific Dockerfiles [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create optimized Dockerfiles for each service (Frontend, API, and PostgreSQL) that follow best practices for multi-stage builds, minimal base images, and architecture compatibility.
### Details:
1. Create Frontend Dockerfile:
   - Use multi-stage build with Node.js
   - First stage for building with `node:16` as base
   - Second stage with `node:16-alpine` for runtime
   - Include non-root user configuration
   - Add proper COPY commands to optimize caching
   - Set appropriate CMD for development

2. Create API Dockerfile:
   - Use appropriate base image for your API technology
   - Implement multi-stage build if applicable
   - Include health check configuration
   - Set proper working directory and file permissions
   - Add development dependencies for local use

3. Create PostgreSQL Dockerfile:
   - Base on official postgres image
   - Add required extensions
   - Include configuration for both ARM64 and x86_64 architectures
   - Add initialization scripts in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
   - Configure locale and encoding settings

4. Testing approach:
   - Verify each Dockerfile builds successfully
   - Test individual containers by running them with docker run
   - Verify services start correctly
   - Check multi-architecture compatibility using docker buildx

## 2. Configure Docker Compose for Local Development [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a docker-compose.yml file that defines service relationships, networking, and volume configuration for the development environment.
### Details:
1. Create base docker-compose.yml file:
   - Define all three services (frontend, api, postgres)
   - Configure appropriate port mappings (e.g., 3000:3000 for frontend)
   - Set up service dependencies with depends_on
   - Configure named volumes for database persistence
   - Set up shared networks between services
   - Add healthcheck configurations for each service

2. Configure volume mounts for development:
   - Mount local code directories to container working directories
   - Set up PostgreSQL data volume
   - Configure any additional volumes needed for caching or logs

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create .env file template with necessary variables
   - Configure env_file directive in docker-compose.yml
   - Add environment-specific variables directly in compose file
   - Document required variables

4. Add docker-compose.override.yml for development-specific settings:
   - Enable hot-reloading for frontend
   - Configure development-specific commands
   - Add debugging ports and tools

5. Testing approach:
   - Run docker-compose config to validate configuration
   - Test complete environment with docker-compose up
   - Verify all services start in correct order
   - Test network connectivity between services

## 3. Implement Development Scripts and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Create setup scripts, helper utilities, and documentation to streamline the development workflow with Docker.
### Details:
1. Create development helper scripts:
   - Write shell script for initial setup (setup.sh)
   - Create script for database seeding/migrations
   - Add utility for container log viewing
   - Implement script for executing commands in specific containers
   - Add reset/cleanup script for development environment

2. Implement VS Code Dev Containers integration:
   - Create .devcontainer/devcontainer.json configuration
   - Configure recommended extensions
   - Set up container-specific settings
   - Add post-create commands for environment setup

3. Create comprehensive README documentation:
   - Document environment requirements
   - Include step-by-step setup instructions
   - Add troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Document environment variables
   - Explain container architecture and relationships
   - Add commands for common development tasks

4. Implement architecture compatibility testing:
   - Create script to verify compatibility with ARM64/x86_64
   - Document architecture-specific considerations
   - Add fallback options for problematic services

5. Testing approach:
   - Verify all scripts work as expected
   - Test documentation by following setup steps on a clean system
   - Validate VS Code integration
   - Test on different host architectures if possible
