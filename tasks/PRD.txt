# Overview  
EmbedIQ is a cloud-based RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that leverages high-quality embedding search and LLM context-based answers. The platform serves both developers through comprehensive API endpoints and end users via an intuitive web interface. EmbedIQ solves the problem of information overload and context loss when using AI systems by grounding LLM responses in relevant, specific context from user-provided documents.

# Core Features  
## Document Ingestion and Embedding Generation
- Accepts document uploads and processes them into embeddings
- Stores embeddings in PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient vector search
- Preserves document metadata and relationships for improved context retrieval
- Critical for building the knowledge base that powers all other features

## Vector Search and Context Retrieval
- Performs high-performance semantic search using embedding similarity
- Retrieves the most relevant document chunks based on user queries
- Supports multiple search modes (local, global, hybrid, naive, mix)
- Forms the foundation of accurate, context-aware responses

## LLM-Enhanced Responses
- Combines retrieved context with user queries to generate accurate responses
- Provides source attribution for transparency and trust
- Maintains context fidelity between source materials and responses
- Delivers the primary value proposition through AI-augmented knowledge access

## Developer API
- Offers comprehensive API endpoints for integration into applications
- Includes authentication and rate limiting for security and fair usage
- Provides detailed documentation through OpenAPI/Swagger
- Enables third-party developers to leverage RAG capabilities in their products

## Web Interface
- Presents an intuitive UI for direct end-user interaction
- Offers document upload, querying, and results visualization
- Implements responsive design for mobile accessibility
- Makes advanced AI capabilities accessible to non-technical users

# User Experience  
## Developer Persona
- Technical users seeking to integrate RAG capabilities into existing applications
- Values clear documentation, reliable performance, and simple integration
- Prefers programmatic access through well-designed APIs
- Key flows: API key acquisition, documentation reference, endpoint integration

## End User Persona
- Knowledge workers needing to extract insights from large document collections
- Values accuracy, speed, and transparency in AI-generated responses
- Prefers direct interaction through a graphical interface
- Key flows: document upload, query submission, results review with source verification

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, minimalist interface that emphasizes content over controls
- Progressive disclosure of technical details for different user technical levels
- Source attribution for building trust in AI-generated responses
- Mobile responsiveness for access across devices
