# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement PostgreSQL Database with Vector Extensions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up PostgreSQL database with pgvector and Apache AGE extensions, create data models and migration scripts.
# Details:
Configure PostgreSQL container with pgvector for vector storage and Apache AGE for graph relationships. Define SQLAlchemy ORM models for User, Document, Chunk, Query, and Response entities. Create Alembic migration scripts for schema management. Implement database connection pooling and configuration. Set up indexes for vector similarity search optimization. Address any ARM64 compatibility issues identified during Docker setup.

# Test Strategy:
Run migrations and verify schema creation. Test vector operations with sample data. Validate query performance with execution plans. Ensure proper index creation. Test connection pooling under load conditions.
